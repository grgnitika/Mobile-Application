# AHostelApplication

My Hostel is a hostel based application where the hostelers can get notices about the updates
of the hostel and file up the complaint, services repair, and apply for leave forms. The primary 
objective of the application is to ease the filling and maintenance of complaints by the students 
and management respectively. It saves a lot of time and reduces a great deal of paper work.
